# Instructions

Welcome to the Kahoot intern frontend assignment.

This is a simplified version of the assignment we give to regular candidates. We have already given you an almost completed project to start on so that you can focus on the most important parts of the code. Please follow these steps:

1. Read the `full-instructions.pdf` manual for the initial assignment
2. Note that 90% of the assignment is already completed here in this repository
3. For the last 10%, we want you to add the missing code here: `src/components/PlayerItems.tsx:68`. By writing this function, you will make sure that the application works as specified in the instructions.
4. Bonus point: Currently, the buttons are not accessible by keyboard. Please fix so that they are keyboard-friendly like normal buttons.
5. Please document any assumptions or notes you want to share below, at the bottom of this readme.
